# Contributing

The goal of this repo is to include primarily projects that are stable and useful to many developers.

## Submission Guidelines

- For submitting new tools:
  - It is preferable to prepare and complete the tool's documentation first at its primary location as we prefer to direct users to the relevant links from within the index page (`README.md`).
  - Add your tool's relevant information to the index page (`README.md`). Use a similar format to other tools.
  - If you would like to include and link to an image, you can add it under the [`media` folder](./media/), and include it in the same pull request.
  - Create a pull request with the changes against the `main` branch.
- For editing existing tracked tools:
  - Create a pull request directly with the changes needed against the `main` branch.

_ðŸ’¡Note_: The `details` folder consists of selected tool's information that have been collected to summarize useful features and resources for the audience. However, this is only included for tools that have a lack of available documentation. Therefore, it is preferable for new and existing project owners to complete their documentation and any relevant materials at the project's primary location so that users can be directed to this information from the index page. However, please feel free to make a PR to update incorrect or outdated information in the `details` folder as it still provides valuable insights in the meantime.

## Removing projects

Projects are not removed unless they are outright broken, pronounced deprecated by its author or made redundant by another project.
